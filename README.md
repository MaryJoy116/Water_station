The admin side of a water refilling system serves as the central control panel for managing the entire business operation. 
After logging in securely, the administrator gains access to various key features. 
These include user management, where the admin can create, edit, or deactivate accounts for customers and staff. 
The admin can also handle order management by viewing incoming orders, updating their statuses, and assigning them to delivery personnel. 
Inventory management is another critical function, allowing the admin to monitor stock levels of water bottles and supplies, set low-stock alerts, and track refill activity. 
On the financial side, the admin can review transactions, generate invoices, and manage refunds or disputes. 
Additionally, the system provides reporting tools for tracking sales, customer activity, and inventory trends. T
he admin panel also includes settings for adjusting prices, setting working hours, and defining delivery zones. 
To ensure security and efficiency, the system logs user activity, supports regular database backups, and allows for role-based access control. 
Optional features may include customer feedback, promotional tools, and email marketing integration, all aimed at enhancing customer service and business performance.
